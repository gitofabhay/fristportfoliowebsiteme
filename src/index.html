This website is the project I picked to master web development and also make side by side. <br> I've passion for competitive programming but I know it's tough, but we are fighting for it too. Anyways, I wish I could say that I'm <br>

        <h1>How I Learn</h1> <hr>
        <p>
            I'm not your typical bookworm or workaholic‚Äîlearning for me is all about the excitement of building something. Take web development, for example. My motivation isn't just to learn code; it's about creating something big, like a crazy social media platform. So I learn by doing. I start building, and as I go, I pick up the pieces I need to get it right. That‚Äôs how I roll: follow the 'learn while building' vibe, get it done, and then fine-tune it to make it even better.
